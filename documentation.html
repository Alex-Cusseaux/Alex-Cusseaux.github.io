            <h3>The Destruction and preservation of nature: oneness of diversity</h3>
            <p>
              The destruction of the environment due to mankind is an ongoing issue, yet we lack determination to make a difference. Despite this, we still try to preserve beauty, often failing because of our disinterest. We humans are often too busy with our own lives. We forget to stand still and experience, observe and bask in the beauty of nature and the world that surrounds us. There are always exceptions, but not many people take time to look at the small things that are happening all around them. This leads those people to be unaware of the beauty in trivial things, instead creating an “oneness” of objects in their mind where all things are lumped together and labelled as a specific object.
            </p>

            <p>
              Everyone knows that moss is a plant-like organism that exists and many have looked at it at one point or another. But that does not mean that they have ever seen it. this is very evident when going through peoples general descriptions of moss:  “fluffy”,  “greenish” or “strange”. This is what I refer to when I am talking about “oneness”. It is often the case that we only pay mind to one specific thing and label everything else that is similar under the same category. This way of thinking disables us from realizing the vast diversity of it in the world. While moss could be considered a type of parasite, it can also be incredibly beautiful. Some mosses are slimy and wet while others have beautiful cup-like shapes. Furthermore, they come in a variety of colour, ranging from off-whites, to cadmium yellows, to fresh viridian greens.  Their appearances change depending on the location, exposure to sunlight and surface upon which it grows. This is one example of nature that experiences “oneness”. Despite this, the differences in moss types are used to create atmospheres in films. This prompts people to create an image of what the atmosphere should be like, even when not aware of it. While many people try to get rid of it or tame it, I have chosen to embrace its beauty. Discovering this has changed my life. I now try to observe everything. My passion has spread like a good piece of music, or like a parasite. Friends and family now observe things as I do and understand how something so small can have such a great impact.
            </p>

            <p>
              For the past two years, I have utilized my knowledge of art to better understand objects that surround us on a daily basis. Whether it is the form of a water bottle, or the way the colours of objects fade together where surfaces change. After studying and observing these everyday objects, I might get inspired and integrate elements of the observations into my work, exposing others to the beauty that often goes unnoticed. Being mindful of nature and the present moment is what I wish to express through my works.
            </p>

            <p>
              There is a big difference between the appearance of man-made structures and natural ones, even if humans try to re-create the structure of nature as so many movements have in the history of art. My idea of preserving nature originated from a visit to the “Mater Museum” exhibition in 2016.  Located at the Botanique in Brussels, the exhibition featured an artist named Vincent Glowinski, and also his mother, Agnes Debizet.lowinski is a French artist who creates works that are often related to anatomy and morphology. His started out performing graffiti on buildings throughout Brussels of the animals that he could relate to in life, creating the works he has become famous for in the city. It led to his nickname, “Bonom”, which comes from the contraction of “bonobo” and “homme” or part animal/part human.
            </p>

            <p>
              While “Bonom” continues to perform graffiti throughout the city, he also creates sculptures of prehistoric animals made out of animal skins in the studio. At the Mater Museum exhibition, the sculptures were situated in an oppressive and dark environment. It felt as if one was walking into a creepy abandoned version of an old history museum. The skins are sewn together roughly with big visible stitches, making it imperfect. The way the skins were stretched created an interesting texture, a worn old look, that resembled a dusty old mummy. I recall having an unsettling feeling upon entering, for the sculptures were made out of the complete opposite substance of what they would be in nature: a skeleton made from skin — the internal fashioned out of the external.
            </p>

            <p>
              The way Glowinski’s skins were stretched also made me take note of other things. The use of only earthy color — such as beiges, off whites, and browns — created a very natural feeling. Despite the sewing being rough, the work itself was very detailed. The pieces appeared delicate and fragile, just like nature. However, despite the apparent fragility; the skeleton structures were very strong and durable. Some of the “animals” were hung from strings on the ceiling and were worked like puppets. They would bang against each other, loudly resonating in the enclosed space. This symbolizes the contrast of the fragility of nature against the strength of nature. In my opinion, the puppetry also symbolized how humans have the desire to control nature. Finding this concept intriguing led to my idea regarding the preservation of nature but with flora instead of fauna.
            </p>

            <p>
              When looking at nature closely, it becomes an abstract form, full of colour and patterns. Captivated by the way in which the patterns are formed, I recreated moss while keeping in mind what I had learned from Bonom. I used natural elements — cottons, yarns and textiles — to showcase my ideas. This follows Bonom’s method of creating objects out of the same materials found in nature to recreate their appearance. For one of my pieces I crocheted clumps of moss in bright, bold colours and sewed it on top of bark. It’s big and rough, just like the stitching in Bonom’s work. My rationale for doing this was to show people how patterns, composition and different textures can work together to highlight variation. Furthermore, I wanted to express how exciting moss could look by exaggerating its colour scheme and size. In essence I was able to give the expression that my crochet is growing, spreading, taking over and trying desperately to survive; just like moss. However, this is only a maquette: I want to crochet extremely large patches of moss and place them in trees in the forest for added emphasis. But sadly, I do not own the time or resources to create this at present.
            </p>

            <p>
              Most people have collected leaves and left them to dry pressed between phonebooks at least once in their lifetimes. It seems rather innocent when you see three-year-olds making collages out of dried leaves. However, there is a darker side to this topic that I want to explore. Humans in general want to preserve nature, yet destroy it in the process. Pressing leaves is the perfect example of this destruction of nature. Certainly the beauty of the leaf will be kept for a long time. However, it will be no longer be of any use to the plant that gave it life and where it flourished. Unfortunately, it is part of human nature to obtain what they desire while not taking into consideration the effect it has on the environment. A well-known example of this continued destruction is wildflower picking.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sewing and crochet are things that come naturally to me and they also link back to patterns in multiple ways. The act of looking at nature and making sense of the patterns and textures has added another element to my artwork. One artist who does this extremely well is Gwen Hedley. Hedley transfers the concepts she views in nature to textiles. Her works are well known and showcased in exhibitions around the world. She is one of the UK’s most famous textile artists and well regarded for her use of line and mark making in her works. Throughout my study on Hedley, I have come to fully appreciate how “elemental processes transform structures and surfaces into new forms of beauty” (Hedley, 2017). Hedley closely observes objects, which she puts through a process of drawings that start very delicate and become rougher and less detailed as she repeats the process. Ultimately, she transfers the drawings to textiles to capture the essence of what she initially found beautiful.
            </p>

            <p>
              The above piece shows the process she takes to develop her artwork.  To the average passer-by this is just a rusty piece of metal, hardly worth a second glance. Hedley took that second glance and was intrigued with what she noticed. She started with a collage of coloured paper and used pencils to increase the delicacy of the piece. This turned into a sewn piece of work, which lost even more detail as she reduced the size. In the end, she is left with a very textured drawing, worked into her textile pieces.
            </p>

            <p>
              Helen Parrott has also inspired me to use more patterns in my artwork. Parrott is an artist and a contemporary quilt maker who is well known for her use of simple stitched lines and seasonal landscapes. She has an intriguing way of making marks and rough drawings to create artwork that is graphically compelling. Her initial inspiration comes from the natural environment, which she recreates through texture and pattern. It was her work that pushed me to use more textiles in my own artwork.
            </p>

            <p>
              Determined to learn as much as possible about textiles, I researched other artists who use this medium to express their ideas. Thankfully, my art teacher introduced me to Janet Baguley, a primarily textile based artist. I was given the fantastic opportunity to go through her college sketchbook and obtained a lot of ideas about how to effectively use embroidery. Like Parrott, Baguley’s work is primarily inspired by nature. It is apparent how she transfers elements from nature onto textiles. For example, she uses seedpods and colored gauche studies followed by white grayscale gauche studies and various line types. Finally, she completes her work with delicately sown embroidery pieces.
            </p>

            <p>
              One of the pieces that I particularly like is the one that is thread drawing, similar to darning. It is done on a piece of jute fabric. By undoing the woven fibre itself, holes are created that she wove together with a different thread. She also added some wooden beads and pumpkin seeds.  This reminds me of the insides of a pumpkin. It looks very natural due to the colour used and the seeds/beads, but it also links with my topic of how humans by default try to preserve what they find beautiful. To me, this piece shows that even if we try, we can never make it look like the original. Her work made me realize that a lot of people from my generation do not know these handicrafts - embroidery, crochet, knitting, cross stitch, etc. These crafts are no longer taught in schools and therefore people know these skills are disappearing rapidly. However, there are a lot of books and magazines trying to get newer generations back into the traditional crafting by making it “cool” and more applicable to modern-day life.
            </p>

            <p>
              Baguley’s work motivated me to experiment with embroidery to recreate moss. Instead of trying to pull my viewer in from afar, which was my goal with the large crochet piece, I wanted people to appreciate the intricate details and subtle colour found in nature. Because embroidery is so delicate I chose it as my medium. I used cotton and woollen strings and yarns to create a more natural look. Liking how natural and complementary burlap looks in Janet Baguley’s works, I decided to use it as my base material. I experimented with dying the burlap in several colours, but still wanted the fabric to have a natural feel. With the sewing I was able to highlight the delicate textures and patterns that are also present in real moss but are often ignored by people.The conservation of beauty is also applied to crafts. The craftsmanship of crochet, knitting and embroidery is barely kept alive by artists such as Joana Vasconcelos – a Portuguese artist who has had her work displayed several times at la Biennale di Venezia. Her work often includes themes of feminism, political issues and social issues
            </p>

            <p>
              In conclusion, there are people who want to preserve nature for its beauty but rarely stop to admire the natural beauty of objects that is not preserved. They believe that beauty is only worthwhile when preserved. I believe they should take the time to look around, discover new things and relish in the majesty of nature. I’ve been inspired by many artists over the years. But, it has been the works of Vincent Glowinski, Gwen Hedley, Helen Parrott, Janet Baguley and Joana Vasconcelos that I admire for they appreciate beauty in ordinary objects and use crafts that traditionally have been passed down through generations from mother to daughter to express themselves. I find it a real shame that in many families this no longer takes place. Both my grandmother and mother sill have the skill to participate in these crafts and I am grateful they have passed it down to me. I speak out of experience when I say that these skills are worth learning.
