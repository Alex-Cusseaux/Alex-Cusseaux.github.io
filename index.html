            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
              Art is what motivates me every day. However, it is so much more to me than the act of creating artworks; it is the way to express myself. As a young child, I was diagnosed with dyslexia. While I have managed to progress throughout my academic career and score 1330 on my SAT, it has been a challenge. Some may view dyslexia as a limiting factor in the classroom. But, I view it as something that has taught me the skills of problem solving, thinking outside the box and strategizing the best course of action to successfully complete my tasks.

              When I first started taking Art and Design courses at BSB I found my classes difficult. I thought the structure, confines, lectures and strict teaching style were the opposite of what I then defined as art. For the first year I spent my time applying the theory I learned to structured pieces of work. I felt like I had no individuality, freedom or creativity to express my thoughts. It wasn’t until my second year that I appreciated why it took so much time developing the fundamentals of art. I now realise that art isn’t only about creativity but also about knowing the importance of the process that leads to final outcomes.

              For the past two years, I have utilized my knowledge of art to better understand objects that surround us on a daily basis. Whether it is the form of a water bottle, or the way the colours of objects fade together where surfaces change. After studying and observing these everyday objects, I might get inspired and integrate elements of the observations into my work, exposing others to the beauty that often goes unnoticed. Being mindful of nature and the present moment is what I wish to express through my works.

              Living in Europe for the past 16 years has been a tremendous opportunity to learn about art outside of school. In my free time I visit museums almost every weekend and learn about different periods of art, artists and types of artwork. In 2015 I was invited by the art department to attend the 56th edition of the Biennale in Venice. I was one of the youngest members of the trip, which encouraged me to look at art in a more mature manner than previously. Furthermore, being exposed to    139 contemporary artists from 89 countries reinforced how different cultures interpret the modern world through art and challenge the traditional ideas of art through use of technology and different mediums.

              Visiting Italy also had an enormous impact on how I view cities and understand the influence art played historically. Walking through the city and viewing the world’s most dramatic Renaissance paintings was a constant reminder of how masters like Giovanni Bellini influenced the period. The San Giobbe Altarpiece is one example that inspired me because of the perspective, use of color, texture and light used to transform the piece. From a distance the painting looks like a 3-dimentional object because of the interplay between light and dark. Additionally, I found it fascinating how the artist incorporated light sources from where the church windows would have been positioned to highlight central figures. Viewing frescos and alterpieces in situ along with important pieces of art in major museums offered an unrivalled appreciation for Renaissance art.

              I take great pride in my talent for art and am grateful for the teachers who have instilled a disciplined approach and proper techniques to express my concepts. While I have an excellent foundation it is important that I excel to the next level and be surrounded by the best professors, motivated students and inspirational galleries. Confucius said, “find a job you love and you will never have to work a day in your life.” With enhanced techniques, theory, critical thinking and problem solving skills I will turn my talent into a career that I love.
